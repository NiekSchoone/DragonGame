Astroids Dragon game

This game was made for a project in which we got to make a creative remake of the old arcade game "astroids".
It was a fun project made with 2 developers and 4 artists.

Since this project was build so early on in our developement carreer, there was not a propper deviding between who did what. Both of the programmers were playing around in all off the code making the process quite chaotic, but still we managed to build a good little game out of it.

Obviously we would do alot of things differently now looking back.
The "Levels.as" class is basically serving as the main game loop, which is almost unreadable.
